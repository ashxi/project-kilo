# I want to contribute, where do I start?
You should read along, to find out how to format commits.
## Formatting commits
TLDR: Refer to this format.
```
type: This has to start with a capital letter, and ends with proper punctuation, spelled correctly. Valid types are feature, chore, fix, and other.
```
### Type
There are three valid types that we will accept, and those are `feature`, `chore`, `fix`, and `other`. These are at the beginning, and must be lowercase, and end with `:`, with a space.
### Punctuation
Spell correctly, and please try to commit in any type of English. Capitalize first, and end properly. 
## JSDoc, JSDoc, JSDoc!
If you make more functions, especially in the Brew API, be sure to JSDoc what you add! [Here's documentation.](https://jsdoc.app/)
Also, please just document your code anyways.
